# Content

[TOC]

# Introduction

* Analyses the video to find segment boundaries which provide a coherent view of the entire video.
* The segment boundaries displayed can be used to navigate to different sections of the video.
* They may be further refined by the use of external signals such as viewer behavior data.
* Eventually, they can be used for summarization of the video.


# User attributes

* Age
* Gender
* Geographical Location
* Time
* General Interests (such as: political leanings, hobbies, profession etc).

# Initial Users

* How do we solve the problem when there is no data present to generate a heat map?
* *Challenges* 
  * Generate meaningful summary points for initial viewers of a particular video.
  * Should not skew results of early users.

# Local Summarization
# Heat map
# Architecture

* Implemented as a Chrome Extension
* Client-server architecture (Model-View-Controller)
  * JavaScript front-end 
  * Node backend 
  * SQLite3 DB


# Design & Rationale
* Showing randomly generated summaries to new viewers
* Use section boundaries and measures of quality to determine summary.
* The good
  * Helps the first viewers.
* The bad
  * May not work well for all videos.
* Build knowledge of user section viewership based on age and demographic to improve summaries

# Future Work

* Currently videos are segmented relying solely on video attributes - audio attributes could also be considered in segmentation.
* Button to quickly skip between segments.
